                    It's been five years since the Zombie King attacked the remaining survivors in Knox Country. The survivors' victory knocked out the Zombie King and sent him back to where he came from. However, the departure of this creature left a big impact on the world, and Knox Country was no exception.

                    The survivors became very strong and brave. They force themselves to adjust to the new environment and coexist with the zombies. Their days are spent killing these creatures relentlessly and heartlessly. But one thing they do not realize, the zombies are also evolving day by day. The zombies that had been hiding in the outskirts of the city and hadn't been exposed to the sun for years, finally started to appear. They are getting stronger and harder to deal with. All those who are still surviving need to be more careful in taking steps when exploring.

                    A new civilization has finally begun, with something different and also new challenges. Ease comes at the right time now, but difficulties also come at the same time. Can the survivors of Knox Country make it through?
